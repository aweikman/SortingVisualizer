# Sorting Visualizer

![](GIT.gif)

*The gif above showcases the Bubble sort algorithm animation using JavaFX.*

## Description:
This project was made as a tool for visualizing sorting algorithms. This app allows users to
select between different sorting algorithms and view the sort in real time through animation. The
user has the option to change the size of the sorted array, as well as the speed of the sort to suit their needs. With a clean and easy to navigate GUI the user can learn about these sorting algorithms with ease.

## Available algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Selection sort
- Quicksort

### Known Bugs:
- None at this time :)

### Version/Requirements:
- Works with intellij and eclipse.
